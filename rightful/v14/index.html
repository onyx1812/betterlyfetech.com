            I have been using Rightful for six months, and I have had a noticeable improvement in my recovery time from
            my workouts. It has also helped me sleep better at night. Rightful is an important part of my nightly
            routine.

            This combination of Rightful really works. I used to suffer from debilitating back, shoulder, and neck pain,
            and nothing helped until I found Rightful. With Rightful, my pain was halved in 2 weeks and keeps on
            improving as time goes by. Thank you Rightful, you have changed my life.

            Rightful is amazing. As a firefighter/paramedic, my recovery and sleep are so important. With Rightful, I
            was able to eliminate the number of supplements I use daily. I fall asleep and stay asleep better. I wake up
            feeling more recovered/refreshed. I notice less soreness and faster recovery. I absolutely recommend giving
            it a try!

              I started using Rightful based on a recommendation from my doctor, who thought it could help the chronic
              pain I have in my hands, hips and back. He was right! After three weeks I don't ache like I used to, and
              I'm sleeping great. Best of all, I no longer need to take daily anti-inflammatory pills.

              It’s helping! Even after just 10 days I can feel a noticeable reduction in joint aches and pains. Rarely
              when I take supplements can I feel a difference, I just take them on faith, but this time I can actually
              notice a difference.

              Love it!! I was popping Aleve and other anti-inflammatory meds like candy. This has brought me such relief
              for my joint pain and helps me sleep at night! I also suspect it helped bring my A1C down.
