              <strong>Foot Pain Ruins a Grandparent’s Life</strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              What if you could go outside and play with your grandchildren
              without fear of crippling pain? Wouldn’t it be fantastic if you
              could have fun outside like you were 35 again? Hiking, playing,
              maybe even doing a little work in the yard?
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Well, thanks to DoctorInsole, this fantasy has become a reality
              for seniors and grandparents nationwide!
            </p>

              <strong>
                Foot Pain Is Complicated
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              The human foot has 26 bones and 33 joints, and the older we get
              there is a greater chance for a variety of issues. Foot pain
              affects roughly one in four people over 65. For older women
              especially, studies show there are major risk factors for the
              development of foot pain.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              These foot pains can be caused by pinched toes, bunions, plantar
              fasciitis, weak ankles or any other number of issues.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              One grandmother told us this story:
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              “After the grandchildren were here recently, my feet felt like
              they had gone through a triathlon. I tried keeping up with my
              grandson and had to slow down even when he said "grandma come
              play!" It broke my heart. But then I started wearing these new
              orthotic insoles and they literally changed my life!”
            </p>
            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                Those Old Orthotics and Insoles Aren’t Worth It
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Up until now, seniors had mostly store-bought insoles to rely on
              or expensive orthotics. Basically, cheap pieces of rubber that
              only provide a little support or expensive orthotics that cost an
              arm and a leg.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Making matters worse, these insoles or inserts only worked with
              certain kinds of shoes. No sandals, no flats, even most boots
              wouldn’t work.
            </p>

            <p class="text md">
              Luckily, a top podiatrist designed an orthotic insole that’s
              perfect for any senior who wants to enjoy outdoor activities.

                The Secret Revealed

            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Here’s the secret about DoctorInsole, it’s the first “over the
              counter” custom grade orthotic insole. It is as close to a fully
              custom product as you can get without going to the doctor, but it
              comes at a fraction of the cost of custom orthotics.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              It stabilizes your foot and ankle in all three plains of motion
              and provides support for flat feet, plantar fasciitis, high arches
              and other foot problems.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              The patented design of DoctorInsole was created in part by an
              actual doctor who works with feet. A top podiatrist saw so many
              problems with people’s feet that he took his knowledge and helped
              create a real solution.

              high arches, back pain, and shin splints will begin to disappear
              and you’ll be more willing to go on long walks, hikes and runs.
