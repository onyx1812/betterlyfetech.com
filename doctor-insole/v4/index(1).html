              <strong>Millions Suffer From Foot Pain... </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              What if I told you 1000’s of people everyday are buying a
              doctor-designed insole that makes foot pain a thing of the past?
              Wouldn’t it be amazing if your foot pain had a real solution, a
              real way to deal with the dull aches, the plantar fasciitis and
              the crippling pain?
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Thanks to DoctorInsole, there’s an actual solution to foot and
              back pain, a real way to hike, walk, play, jog and simply live.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                How Do You Get Relief?
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              The human foot has 26 bones and 33 joints, and the more you use
              your feet the more chances there are for real problems. From
              pinched toes, bunions, plantar fasciitis, weak ankles or any other
              number of issues, foot problems suck!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              A recent government study shows 20% of Americans report foot pain
              and the number for women is much higher. Making matters worse, 8%
              of all adults (that's 16 million people) suffer from long term
              back pain.

              <strong>
                Those Old Orthotics and Insoles Aren’t Worth It
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Up until now, most people had to rely on store-bought insoles or
              expensive orthotics. Some folks would try icing their feet
              everyday or even their back, but did you know that can cause nerve
              damage? Basically, cheap pieces of rubber that only provide a
              little support, expensive orthotics that cost an arm and a leg or
              painful ice baths.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Making matters worse, most insoles or inserts only worked with
              certain kinds of shoes. No sandals, no flats, even most boots
              wouldn’t work.
            </p>

            <p class="text md">
              Luckily, a top podiatrist designed an orthotic insole that’s
              perfect for anyone who spends hours upon hours on their feet day
              after day.

                The Secret Revealed

            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Here’s the secret about DoctorInsole, it’s the first “over the
              counter” custom grade orthotic insole. It is as close to a fully
              custom product as you can get without going to the doctor, but it
              comes at a fraction of the cost of custom orthotics.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              It stabilizes your foot and ankle in all three plains of motion
              and provides support for flat feet, plantar fasciitis, high arches
              and other foot problems.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              The patented design of DoctorInsole was created in part by an
              actual doctor who works with feet. A top podiatrist saw so many
              problems with people’s feet that he took his knowledge and helped
              create a real solution.
