            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Wouldn’t it be nice to know what insole nurses, waitresses, chefs
              and doctors use? Nurses working 60+ hours a week to keep people
              alive, waitresses working 12 hour shifts to pay the bills, and
              chefs making your special dinner are on their feet constantly.
              Knowing what orthotic insoles they recommend would be awesome…
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Thanks to one nurse, one of our nation’s unsung heroes, we know
              that DoctorInsole is quickly becoming the #1 preferred insole for
              nurses everywhere.

                This Nurse’s Feet Holds The Truth...
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              A nurse working at one of the nation’s busiest hospitals explained
              why she needed insoles:
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              “Over the last year, I’ve been working 12-14 hour shifts 5 or 6
              days a week, sometimes without getting more than a 15-minute
              break. I used to wear store-bought insoles and then my boyfriend
              bought these for me on my birthday and there is no comparison.
              Even after hours of standing, my feet felt great. I was exhausted
              after a long shift, but my feet weren’t in severe pain at all! I
              recommended these to every nurse in our hospital and they’re all
              using them!”
            </p>

              <strong>
                Those Old Orthotics and Insoles Aren’t Worth It
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Up until now, nurses, waitresses, chefs and other folks on their
              feet all day had mostly store-bought insoles to rely on or
              expensive orthotics. Basically, cheap pieces of rubber that only
              provide a little support or expensive orthotics that cost an arm
              and a leg.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Making matters worse, these insoles or inserts only worked with
              certain kinds of shoes. No sandals, no flats, even most boots
              wouldn’t work.

              Luckily, a top podiatrist designed an orthotic insole that’s
              perfect for anyone who spends hours upon hours on their feet day

                The Secret Revealed

            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Here’s the secret about DoctorInsole, it’s the first “over the
              counter” custom grade orthotic insole. It is as close to a fully
              custom product as you can get without going to the doctor, but it
              comes at a fraction of the cost of custom orthotics.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              It stabilizes your foot and ankle in all three plains of motion
              and provides support for flat feet, plantar fasciitis, high arches
              and other foot problems.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              The patented design of DoctorInsole was created in part by an
              actual doctor who works with feet. A top podiatrist saw so many
              problems with people’s feet that he took his knowledge and helped
              create a real solution.

              DoctorInsole provides support for all sorts of different

              you try these insoles, you’ll notice how they dramatically improve
              how your feet feel, but they also improve so much more:

            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Severe pains from such problems as plantar fasciitis, flat feet,
              high arches, back pain, and shin splints will begin to disappear
              and you’ll be more willing to go on long walks, hikes and runs.
