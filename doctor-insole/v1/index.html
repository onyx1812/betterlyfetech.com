              <strong>From Foot Pain To Foot Bliss</strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Wouldn’t it be nice to know what insole nurses, waitresses, chefs,
              and doctors use? Nurses working 60+ hours per week to keep people
              alive, waitresses working 12-hour shifts to pay the bills, and
              chefs making your special dinner are on their feet constantly.
              Knowing what orthotic insoles they recommend would be awesome…
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Thanks to one nurse, one of our nation’s unsung heroes, we know
              that DoctorInsole is quickly becoming the #1 preferred insole for
              nurses everywhere.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                This Nurse’s Feet Holds The Truth...
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              A nurse working at one of the nation’s busiest hospitals explained
              why she needed insoles:
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              “Over the last year, I’ve been working 12 to 14 hour shifts 5 or 6
              days a week, sometimes without getting more than a 15-minute
              break. I used to wear store-bought insoles - then my boyfriend
              bought these for me on my birthday, and there is no comparison.
              Even after hours of standing, my feet felt great. I was exhausted
              after a long shift, but my feet weren’t in severe discomfort at
              all! They actually molded to my feet after just a few days; it’s
              like they knew who I was. I recommended these to every nurse in
              our hospital and they’re all using them!”
            </p>
            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                Those Old Orthotics and Insoles Aren’t Worth It
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Up until now, nurses, waitresses, chefs, and other folks on their
              feet all day had mostly store-bought insoles to rely on, or
              expensive orthotics. Basically, either cheap pieces of rubber that
              only provide a little support or expensive orthotics that cost an
              arm and a leg.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Making matters worse, these insoles or inserts only worked with
              certain kinds of shoes. No sandals, no flats - even most boots
              wouldn’t work.
            </p>

                DoctorInsole, The Solution to Your Foot Problems

            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Luckily, a top podiatrist designed an orthotic insole that’s
              perfect for anyone who spends hours upon hours on their feet, day
              after day.

                The Secret Revealed
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Here’s the secret about DoctorInsole: it’s the first
              “over-the-counter” custom-grade orthotic insole. It is as close to
              a fully-custom product as you can get without going to the doctor,
              but it comes at a fraction of the cost of custom orthotics.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              It stabilizes your foot and ankle in all three planes of motion
              and provides support for flat feet, plantar fasciitis, high
              arches, and other foot problems. DoctorInsole molds to your foot,
              taking its exact shape and providing amazing support.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              The patented design of DoctorInsole was created in part by an
              actual doctor who works with feet, a top podiatrist, who saw so
              many problems with people’s feet that he took his knowledge and
              helped create a real solution.
            </p>

              <strong>
                How DoctorInsole Works
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              DoctorInsole uses a high-density memory foam that molds to your
              foot as you wear it, providing a customized level of comfort and
              correction. It provides strong arch support and ankle stability
              for all sorts of different activities, including walking and
              hiking.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Once you try these insoles, you’ll see a day-by-day improvement in
              how your feet feel.
            </p>

            <p class="text md">
              <strong>Week 1</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              You should start to see a noticeable improvement in how your feet
              feel.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Your feet will feel revived and you’ll notice more ankle
              stabilization.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              You’ll even notice better balance!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              <strong>Week 2</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              You should begin to see improvement in foot problems such as
              plantar fasciitis, flat feet, high arches, back aches, and shin
              splints. You might even be more willing to go on long walks,
              hikes, and runs.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              <strong>Week 3</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              You’ll experience better posture as DoctorInsole restores your
              natural alignment. You’ll see bunion reduction and prevention, and
              even lessened fatigue.

                  began feeling stable, so I can walk everyday or run around
                  with my grandkids and my feet are pain free. I've always been
