              <strong>The Problem with Flat Feet </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              What if I told you there was finally an effective remedy to
              soreness caused by your flat feet? Wouldn’t it be amazing if you
              could walk, run, hike, jog, and simply live without the daily
              reminder of your fallen arches and foot problems?
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Thanks to DoctorInsole, this dream is now a reality. Your flat
              feet don’t have to hold you back any longer. They can actually
              hiking, running, walking anywhere - forests, mountains, down the
              street...anywhere you can imagine.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                How Many Are Suffering?
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              According to the National Foot Health Assessment, about 18 million
              of U.S. adults have flat feet. Another 8 million people, have
              fallen arches. Flat feet and fallen arches are a common condition
              which occurs when the arches don't develop during childhood. In
              other cases, flatfeet develop after an injury or from the simple
              wear-and-tear stresses of age.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Flat feet contribute to problems in your ankles and knees because
              the condition can alter the alignment of your legs. They also
              cause chronic foot pain, which is unbearable for millions of
              Americans.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                Those Old Orthotics and Insoles Aren’t Worth It
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Until now, most people had to rely on store-bought insoles or
              expensive orthotics. Some folks would try icing their feet
              everyday, but that causes nerve damage! Basically, either cheap
              pieces of rubber that only provide a little support, expensive
              orthotics that cost an arm and a leg, or ice baths were your best
              choices.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Making matters worse, most insoles or inserts only worked with
              certain kinds of shoes - no sandals, no flats, and even most boots
              wouldn’t work.
            </p>

                DoctorInsole, The Solution to Your Foot Problems
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Luckily, a top podiatrist designed an orthotic insole that’s
              perfect for anyone who spends hours upon hours on their feet, day
              after day.

                Tackling Flat Feet Fast

            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Here’s the secret about DoctorInsole: it’s the first
              “over-the-counter” custom-grade orthotic insole. It is as close to
              a fully-custom product as you can get without going to the doctor,
              but it comes at only a fraction of the cost of custom orthotics.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              It stabilizes your foot and ankle in all three planes of motion
              and provides support for flat feet, plantar fasciitis, high arches
              and other foot problems. DoctorInsole molds to your foot, taking
              its exact shape and providing amazing support.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              The patented design of DoctorInsole was created in part by an
              actual doctor who works with feet, a top podiatrist, who saw so
              many problems with people’s feet that he took his knowledge and
              helped create a real solution.

                How DoctorInsole Works
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              DoctorInsole uses a high-density memory foam that helps the
              custom-grade orthotic insole mold to your foot as you wear it,
              providing a customized level of comfort and correction. It
              provides strong arch support and ankle stability for all sorts of
              different activities, from walking and hiking to running and
              working.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Once you try these insoles, you’ll notice how they dramatically
              improve how your feet feel, but they also improve so much more:

            <p class="text md">
              <strong>Week 1</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text md">

            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Your feet will feel revived and you’ll notice more ankle
              stabilization.

            <p class="text md">
              You’ll even notice better balance!

              plantar fasciitis, flat feet, high arches, back aches, and shin
              splints. You might even be more willing to go on long walks,
              hikes, and runs.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
