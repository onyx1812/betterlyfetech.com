              <strong>Top Foot Doc Has Some Advice </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Wouldn’t it be nice to learn firsthand from a doctor how best to
              handle foot and back pain? What if you could sit down with your
              own personal doctor for as long as you’d like, learn what’s wrong
              with your feet, and then have your foot problems addressed?
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Thanks to DoctorInsole, you can enjoy the next best thing - a
              podiatrist-designed insole that addresses your specific foot
              problems.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                Listen to the Doctor
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              One of the nation’s top podiatrists who works with thousands of
              people a year had some grave warnings:
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              A recent study shows 20% of Americans have serious foot pain, and
              that the number for women is much higher. Making matters worse, 8%
              of all adults (that's 16 million people) suffer from long-term
              back pain. So many people don’t understand the back is directly
              tied to the feet!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Your feet have more than 100 muscles, but you don't use all those
              muscles while walking or standing. When people walk the wrong way,
              when your feet are wrongly aligned, your knees and hips follow and
              then your back falls into misalignment.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              This contributes to lower-back pain; so, oddly enough, injured,
              hurting feet are directly related to an injured, hurting back.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                Those Old Orthotics and Insoles Aren’t Worth It
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Up until now, people suffering from foot and back aches only had
              store-bought insoles to rely on, or expensive orthotics.
              Basically, either cheap pieces of rubber that only provide a
              little support or expensive orthotics that cost an arm and a leg.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              “So many of my patients rely on the wrong things to solve the
              problem. I tell them they need something that blends the gel of an
              insert with the custom-fit of an orthotic,” the podiatrist said.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Making matters worse, these insoles or inserts only worked with
              certain kinds of shoes; no sandals, no flats, and even most boots
              wouldn’t work.
            </p>

                DoctorInsole, The Solution to Your Foot Problems

            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Luckily, a top podiatrist designed an orthotic insole that’s
              perfect for anyone who spends hours upon hours on their feet day
              after day.

                The Secret Revealed
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Here’s the secret about DoctorInsole, it’s the first
              “over-the-counter” custom grade orthotic insole. It is as close to
              a fully custom product as you can get without going to the doctor,
              but it comes at a fraction of the cost of custom orthotics.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              It stabilizes your foot and ankle in all three planes of motion
              and provides support for flat feet, plantar fasciitis, high arches
              and other foot problems. DoctorInsole molds to your foot, taking
              the exact shape and providing amazing support.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              The patented design of DoctorInsole was created in part by an
              actual doctor who works with feet, a top podiatrist, saw so many
              problems with people’s feet that he took his knowledge and helped
              create a real solution.
            </p>

                How DoctorInsole Works
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              DoctorInsole uses a high-density memory foam that helps the
              custom-grade orthotic insole mold to your foot as you wear it,
              providing a customized level of comfort and correction. It
              provides strong arch support and ankle stability for all sorts of
              different activities, from walking and hiking to running and
              working.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Once you try these insoles, you’ll notice how they dramatically
              improve how your feet feel, but they also improve so much more:
            </p>

            <p class="text md">
              <strong>Week 1</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              You should start to see a noticeable improvement in how your feet
              feel.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Your feet will feel revived and you’ll notice more ankle
              stabilization.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              You’ll even notice better balance!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              <strong>Week 2</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              You should begin to see improvement in foot problems such as
              plantar fasciitis, flat feet, high arches, back aches, and shin
              splints. You might even be more willing to go on long walks,
              hikes, and runs.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              <strong>Week 3</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              You’ll experience better posture as DoctorInsole restores your
              natural alignment. You’ll see bunion reduction and prevention, and
              even lessened fatigue.
