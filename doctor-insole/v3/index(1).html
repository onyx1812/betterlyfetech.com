              <strong>Top Foot Doc Has Some Advice </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Wouldn’t it be nice to learn first hand from a doctor how best to
              handle foot and back pain? What if you could sit down with your
              own personal doctor for as long as you’d like, learn what’s wrong
              with your feet and then have your foot problems addressed?
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Thanks to DoctorInsole, you can enjoy the next best thing - a
              podiatrist-designed insole that addresses your specific foot
              problems.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                Listen to the Doctor
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              One of the nation’s top podiatrists who works with thousands of
              people a year had some grave warnings:
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              A recent study shows 20% of Americans have serious foot pain and
              the number for women is much higher. Making matters worse, 8% of
              all adults (that's 16 million people) suffer from long term back
              pain. So many people don’t understand the back is directly tied to
              the feet!”
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Your feet have more than 100 muscles, but you don't use all those
              muscles while walking or standing. When people walk the wrong way,
              when your feet are wrongly aligned, your knees and hips follow and
              then your back falls into misalignment.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              This contributes to lower back pain, so oddly enough injured,
              hurting feet are directly related to an injured, hurting back.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title md">
              <strong>
                Those Old Orthotics and Insoles Aren’t Worth It
              </strong>
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Up until now, people suffering from foot and back pain only had
              store-bought insoles to rely on or expensive orthotics. Basically,
              cheap pieces of rubber that only provide a little support or
              expensive orthotics that cost an arm and a leg.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              “So many of my patients rely on the wrong things to solve the
              problem. I tell them they need something that blends the gel in an
              insert with the custom-fit of an orthotic,” the podiatrist said.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Making matters worse, these insoles or inserts only worked with
              certain kinds of shoes. No sandals, no flats, even most boots
              wouldn’t work.
            </p>

            <p class="text md">
              Luckily, a top podiatrist designed an orthotic insole that’s
              perfect for anyone who spends hours upon hours on their feet day

                The Secret Revealed

            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              DoctorInsole is taking the world by storm because of one trick
              other insole creators never thought of...doctors!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              See the patented design of DoctorInsole was created in part by an
              actual doctor who works with feet. A top podiatrist saw so many
              problems with people’s feet that he took his knowledge and helped
              create a real solution.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              DoctorInsole is the first “over the counter” custom grade orthotic
              insole. It is as close to a fully custom product as you can get
              without going to the doctor, but it comes at a fraction of the
              cost of custom orthotics.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              It stabilizes your foot and ankle in all three plains of motion
              and provides support for flat feet, plantar fasciitis, high arches
              and other foot problems.

              activities, from walking and hiking to running and working. Once

              how your feet feel, but they also improve so much more:
            </p>

            <p class="text md">

              You’ll even notice better balance!

              Severe pains from such problems as plantar fasciitis, flat feet,
              high arches, back pain, and shin splints will begin to disappear
              and you’ll be more willing to go on long walks, hikes and runs.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              <strong>Week 3</strong>
