          <h1>BREAKING: "Big Oil" Wants This Clever Fuel Saving Device Banned For Good</h1>
          <img src="../assets/1.jpg" class="img-responsive">
          <h2>With The Cost of Gasoline Expected to Rise, Consumers Are Turning To This Fuel-Saving Device</h2>
          <p>If you've noticed your gas prices rising recently, know that they may continue to increase. It is no secret that gasoline prices are expected to rise under the new administration's climate change plan. </p>
          <p>It’s a stark difference from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when prices were on a steep downward trajectory.</p>
          <p>Joe Biden is planning on ending the expansion of the Keystone XL pipeline as part of his plan to confront climate change. The pipeline was expected to bring oil 1,200 miles from Alberta to Nebraska. It has been a top priority for Canada and Canadian officials are urging Biden to reconsider.</p>
          <p>“Cancelling the Keystone XL would mainly hurt consumers by limiting reliable crude oil imports from Canada and again reducing the US’ energy security,” said a industry insider. This move will impact the oil industry and raise gasoline prices across the nation. </p>
          <p>"We could see gas prices reach historical levels, potentially 2–3 times what they are at right now," says an analyst. </p>
          <p>So, to summarize it for you, the new administration's energy policies will most likely affect your wallet.</p>
          <p>But we have good news for you today; the war isn't lost for the ordinary consumer. Thanks to this new fuel-saving technology, you can reduce your car's gas consumption by 15%-35% and do your bit to fight climate change.</p>
          <img src="../assets/2.jpg" class="img-responsive">
          <p>A Japan-based startup company has come up with a new innovative and inexpensive fuel-saving device that helps you not only lower your vehicle's fuel consumption but can also reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
          <p>Within just one month of driving with this fuel-saving chip, the device would pay for itself.</p>
          <h3>
            What is This Device?
          </h3>
          <img src="../assets/7.jpg" class="img-responsive">
          <p>It's called <a href="https://sakmtracker.com/click">Effuel</a>, and it is the first fuel-saving technology of its kind. Initially, it was concealed from the general public because it offered the average consumer the opportunity to save at the gas pump.</p>
          <p>Effuel is a small, compact, affordable, and easy-to-use plug-in unit that optimizes and lowers your vehicle's fuel consumption. It is not hard to understand why this device is "Big Oil's" worst nightmare. They have been trying to hide Effuel from the everyday consumer and even tried to ban it in retail shops.</p>
          <p>These giant oil corporations and gas stations feel threatened by this device and its potential to cut into their massive profits. However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of lower fuel consumption.</p>
          <p>In essence, the Effuel chip provides the opportunity for you to decrease your vehicle's fuel consumption by as much as 35%. Those are phenomenal savings and make it easy to understand why oil companies and gas stations want this device permanently hidden from consumers.</p>
          <p>The money-saving benefits of <a href="https://sakmtracker.com/click">Effuel</a> are unparalleled, and researchers are convinced that this fuel-saving technology can do a great deal of good for the environment. </p>
          <p>Scientists initially spent many months trying to debunk claims of efficiency, but those studies now prove that every vehicle owner should own an Effuel device.</p>
          <h3 class="mtop30">How Does it Work?</h3>
          <img src="../assets/3.jpg" class="img-responsive">
          <p>It's easy. You simply plug it into your car's OBD2 port. The OBD2 port is usually located under the dashboard, beneath the steering wheel column.</p>
          <p>All cars and trucks built and sold in the United States after January 1, 1996, have OBD2 ports. If your vehicle is European, any vehicle made after 2001 will also have an OBD2 port.</p>
          <p>Once you've plugged it in, Effuel will immediately get to work. The fuel-saving chip will remap your car's computer to make everything run more efficiently.</p>
          <h3>Can Big Oil Actually Stop This?</h3>
          <img src="../assets/4.jpg" class="img-responsive">
          <p>After these mega oil companies learned about Effuel, they tried everything in their power to stop it. </p>
          <p>The reality is that this fantastic technology can put a massive dent in their profits. So they have all the incentive in the world to keep this device out of the public eye.</p>
          <p>So, while it isn't outright banned yet, we can't promise it won't be in the future. But as of today, you can still purchase the Effuel fuel-saving chip online.</p>
          <h3 class="mtop30">Is This Device Actually Legal?</h3>
          <img src="../assets/5.jpg" class="img-responsive">
          <p>Effuel is absolutely 100% legal; you're at no legal risk for owning this excellent fuel-saving device because, simply put, you're not breaking any laws.</p>
          <p>While mega oil corporations and your local gas station may be unhappy about this, they cannot stop you from using it at the moment. </p>
          <h3>How Much is it Going To Cost Me?</h3>
          <p>You're probably thinking: Given what this tech can do, it probably costs a fortune. False! Effuel is on sale now for under $40!</p>
          <p>Make sure you get yours while you can, due to recent media attention and mounting pressure from Big Oil, these handy little gadgets may become impossible to find in the near future.</p>
          <h3>Where Can I Buy This Device?</h3>
          <p><a href="https://sakmtracker.com/click"><strong>You can buy it directly from the company's partner website by clicking here.</strong></a></p>
