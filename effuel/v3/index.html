              I don't know why I'm about to tell you this. Honestly, it's pretty embarrassing that as a guy, I didn't know this already...but for the sake of everyone else, I feel I have to share. My dad gave me a free truck and it almost made me go broke. And no, it had nothing to do with repairs.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              You see, after graduating college, I had $50,000 in student loan debt. But I worked hard, and I was finally ready to “make my mark on the world.”
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              While my friends bought fancy cars and apartments downtown, I lived with my parents so that I could save on rent and focus on getting a job. My dad even gave me his old pickup to drive while I “got on my feet” - thanks, mom and dad!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              I couldn’t believe my luck when I got the job of my dreams and a great starting salary, 
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              But then I mapped the drive, and my heart sank. It was a 100 miles round-trip.... My mom saw that I was upset as she looked over my shoulder.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              “That’s so far!” she exclaimed - and she didn’t even know the worst part.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Dad’s truck only got 12 miles to the gallon, with a 15-gallon tank. Once I started the job, I was filling up my gas tank every other day.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
See, I had plenty of music to listen to, but all I could think about was how much money I was wasting. I thought about moving closer to work, but the rents kept going up every time I looked.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
             Then, the worst thing I could imagine happened: Gas prices exploded!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              When we were all home last year, gas prices were super low. But now, I’m spending at least $120 per week on gas, and sometimes more! Can you imagine?
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              I have this truck for free, I live rent-free, but I’m still spending $500+ a month just on gas. If I want to take my girlfriend out, my gas bill goes even higher. I can’t afford to buy a new car without adding to my debt.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              I couldn’t save money or pay off debt - I was freaking out. 
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              I even saw some financial analysts on TV say that with more people driving and the Keystone Pipeline shutting down, gas prices could double or even triple in the near future!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              “My gas bill could get up to $1,000 a month?” I thought to myself. “Oh my God!”
A Long Conversation
            </p>

            <h2 class="title xl">
              A Long Conversation
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              I was desperate. I had a long conversation with my parents about my options and talked with some friends, but no one had a solution.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              While thinking about it some more, I took my dad’s truck in for an oil change - “do it every 3,000 miles son” - and I overheard a conversation a mechanic was having with his team.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">            
              They were discussing this little “tool” that was helping people get way better gas mileage.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              One of them mentioned how easy it was to use, but when I interrupted to find out more he got really upset.
            </p>           
            <p class="text md">
              (Normally I am super shy, but like I said - I was desperate.)
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              “Don’t eavesdrop! Just drive without your AC on if you want to save gas,” he said, almost yelling, which wasn’t helpful at all
            </p>            
            <p class="text md">
              I had already looked at that option, but last summer the average temperature was 93 degrees, and I didn’t feel like going into my dream job every day soaked to the bone in sweat. 
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Plus, it wouldn’t even save me much on gas money!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Now that I knew something could help me save money on gas I searched everywhere. I searched car blogs, mechanic websites, and even some discussion boards until I finally found a thread where some mechanics mentioned the gadget by name. 
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              It was called Effuel.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              They all made it sound like this was the answer to my prayers, but I had to know for sure  because it sounded too good to be true.
            </p>
             <p class="text md">
              Then I found an article that said it was saving people so much money on gas that Big Oil companies were trying to ban it, which made me even more curious.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title xl">
              So, What is Effuel? 
            </h2>
            <figure class="img-wrap">
              <img src="../img/i24.jpg" alt="" />
            </figure>
            <p class="text md">
              Effuel is a compact and easy-to-use gadget that plugs into your car to help you save on fuel. It works with all kinds of vehicles, from SUVs and cars to trucks like mine.
            </p>
             <p class="text md">
              The Effuel chip is actually supposed to decrease a vehicle's fuel consumption by as much as 35%.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              I thought to myself “My gas-guzzling truck could get better gas mileage? I can keep the free truck I got from my dad and get better gas mileage? PERFECT! That’s a win-win for me.”
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Then, I started to do some math… okay, I had to pull out a calculator.
            </p>
             <p class="text md">
              “If I got 35% better gas mileage, I’d save over $100 per month, maybe even more!”
            </p>

             <h2 class="title xl">
              And How Does It Work?
            </h2>
             <p class="text md">
              Thankfully, Effuel is easy to use. All you have to do is plug it into a port by the dashboard, right under the steering wheel column. It’s called the OBD2 port and I guess it’s actually a port that all mechanics know about 
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              At first, I freaked out and thought, “What if my car doesn’t have one of those?” 
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              But then I read that every car and truck built and sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1996 has an OBD2 port.  
            </p>

            <h2 class="title xl">
              Millions of Americans Are Using Effuel
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Even though Effuel was just released to the public, I discovered that more than 2.1 million units have already been sold! Even with no TV advertising and mostly word of mouth promotion, its sales are breaking records.
            </p>
             <p class="text md">
              I almost couldn’t believe it, but then I knew it just had to work. You don't sell 2.1 million units of something unless it does the job.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title xl">
              The Testimonials Are Amazing
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              I spent hours online looking for reviews and testimonials, and people were raving about it. I mean, it really seemed like it worked for people with all kinds of cars.
            </p>

                Love it! My husband installed this in my Tucson and I am now getting about 3 to 4 more miles per the gallon. While that may not sound like a lot to some, but an extra day between fill ups is still an extra day.

             I sat down and thought about it. Everything I was reading said all I had to do was plug this chip into my truck to make it run more efficiently. It all still seemed too good to be true, so I decided to see what people on social media were saying about it.

             Turns Out This Product Was Highlighted On My Favorite Show, I Got To Hear An Expert’s Opinion...
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              I wanted to get an actual car expert’s opinion on this thing, someone who I trusted. Then, I discovered Andy Bantera, host of my favorite TV show “Gem or Junk”, did a full review of this product on his show. Here's what he found:
            </p>
            <p class="text md" style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 30px;color: #7E7E7E;">
              “We tested cars, trucks, SUVs and some other vehicles, all makes and models. We drove them without Effuel and then with it. What we kept finding was Effuel saves 15-35% on gas usage PER VEHICLE. We've busted some huge lies on our show, but this one passed the test.”
            </p>
            <h2 class="title xl">
              After All Of That, It Was Time To See If It Could Actually Save Me Gas And Money...
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              So, after reading all those online reviews, and seeing one of my favorite TV show hosts review it, I decided to jump in and try it.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              I have to say, it blew my mind.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              After installing it I gave it some time to recalibrate my truck, and the following week I started tracking my miles.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              The first week, I was using 10% less gas.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              By the second week, it was up to 20%!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              By the third week, I was getting gas 1-2 times less per week, saving me so much money.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              I told my parents the good news after I knew how great it worked.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              “I’m saving at least $150 per month with this thing.” I exclaimed.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              My mom was shocked. “Wow! Can you buy one for me and your dad?”
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              Which of course I did. I bought two, one for each of them, and they were psyched!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              Now we’re saving hundreds per month on gas!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              I can honestly say Effuel helped me save more than $1,800 a year. 
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              I put all that money toward student loans and I have a good chance of being totally debt-free before I’m 30! It’s like a gift of freedom to myself.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              None of this would have been possible without it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title xl">
              How Much Money Does Effuel Cost?
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">    
              This might be the best part: Effuel is on sale right now for under $40! That’s right, even with heavy consumer demand, Effuel offers this device for less than $40.
            </p>
             <p class="text md">    
              If you are a heavy driver, you drive an SUV or a truck, Effuel should make its money back in 30 days!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">    
              My truck is getting 2-4 more miles per gallon depending on how bad traffic is. But if I leave early enough in the morning, I’m saving so much money it's crazy. You have to try this nifty gadget.

                >You've got to keep an eye on your MPG. For example: When I filled up my car, MPG was 325 max. When I take off from the gas station to the freeway. Keep an eye on the MPG because the 325MPG will take at least 2 mins to jump up to 430MPG and sometimes it will jump more. So basically your car is saving gas with the MPG. It will sometimes drop a huge amount and go up. Yea it does work and saved at least 10%. Sometimes 15% depending on how heavy your foot is on the gas paddle
