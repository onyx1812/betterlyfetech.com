                <p>Car lovers are an intense bunch, aren’t they? Not only do they wash their cars an insane amount, but they won’t allow just anyone to wash, wax and polish their baby.
                </p>
                <p>There is a new auto-detailing product car owners are going gaga over.
                </p>
                <p>First, a story…
                </p>
                <p>Meet <b>Derrick Steinecker</b> a man who owns a successful auto-detailing shop in town.
                </p>
                <p>Classic car owners set appointments three or four weeks in advance to get Derrick’s services.
                </p>
                <p>He is known for making cars shine no matter how dusty and dirty they are.
                </p>
                <p>In fact, Derrick works on his neighbor’s car for a huge discount just because they’re friends.
                </p>
                <p>But one day, Derrick came home and found his neighbor polishing his own car…and actually doing a better job!
                </p>
                </p> <img alt="corvette67" src="./img/corvet.jpg" />

                <p>“I’ve been auto-detailing for seven years and the work he did kicked my butt! I couldn’t believe it.”
                </p>

                <h3>Car Detailers Are Ditching the Wax?
                </h3>
                <p>Derrick was sure he was a great car detailer, but when he saw what his neighbor was doing, he was floored.
                </p>
                <p>See, his neighbor has a 1971 Chevrolet Corvette ZR2 that he treats like it was his baby (it just might be actually).
                </p>
                <p>He told me “Derrick, it’s not that you did a bad job, I just knew this stuff could do better.”
                </p>
                <p>Derrick looked puzzled, and then his neighbor went to his garage and showed him what he was using, this sleek little spray bottle called Fortify Shine Armor™ and said…

                </h3> <img alt="bottles" src="./img/10.jpg" />
                <p class="quote">“Wax takes forever and can leave a film…this stuff is almost too easy and too fun.”

                <p><b>Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️</b> recently became the “detailer’s choice” when it comes to a “Shine Armor” that keeps your vehicle looking new no matter the way for up to 6 months!
                </p>
                <p>And That’s Not All</p>
                <p>Fortify Shine Armor™ goes on smooth and even and rubs in quick without much pressure. Forget those clumpy wax products that need a bodybuilder to rub in right.</p>
                <h3>So…What Did Derrick Thomas Think?
                </h3>
                <p>“Look, I’m old school,” said Derrick. “And I’m proud of the work I do using Collinite 845 and micro-fiber cloths…and of course some Advil for all that elbow pain.”
                </p>
                <p>“But man, that Fortify Shine Armor™ is just something else…it actually shines better, and it is easier to rub in.”
                </p>
                <p>“To me, it goes on so smooth and quick it’ll be easier to fit in like 5 more cars a day and make more money.”

                    <p>The majority of products on the market use the same outdated formula that was invented 50+ years ago. They consist of cheap ingredients that are sourced from China, which can actually be harmful to your paint. Actively applying these products to your car can quickly deteriorate your paint and make it appear dull or washed out.
                    </p>
                    <p>You want something that gives you instant results &mdash; results that gives you compliments and turns heads when you drive by. These are the products that are USA Made, Eco-Friendly, and built for lasting protection like Shine Armors Fortify Quick Coat.
