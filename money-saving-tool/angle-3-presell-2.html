          <p>I learned about six months ago to NEVER trust any price on Amazon… EVER!</p>
          <p>It’s true, there is a secret way to find prices that beat Amazon’s “lowest price” by 10%, 20% and sometimes up to 30%!</p>
          <p>I used to shop on Amazon religiously, like seriously it was my church. I thought I was always getting the best price, but then a friend told me about a way to shop on Amazon for a gift or groceries but actually get a much better price! It’s called Capital One Shopping, a free download that works with every browser on the Internet. As you shop, it searches for the best deals on the Internet, as well as for coupons, discounts and promo codes.</p>
          <p>Think you’re saving money on Amazon? Think again and then think about downloading the BEST APP I HAVE EVER USED!</p>

          </a>
          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>Look, I was buying a TV for my dad who has been stuck indoors for seven months with a 7 year old tv that doesn’t even have HDMI hookups. I went to Amazon, typed in the name of the TV I wanted and then the Capital One Shopping app did this amazing little search in less than a second (it was nuts). Suddenly, I found a way to save like 10% off of a TV! Same TV, same two-day shipping just way cheaper.</p>
          <p>I was able to help my dad and help my wallet.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, the app will find promo codes on Amazon, and sometimes it will show you a better deal on a different website. It’s honestly the greatest app I’ve ever used in my life. I’ve saved a ton of money on home goods, gifts for my family and even an engagement ring for my girlfriend (shhh, don’t tell her).</p>
