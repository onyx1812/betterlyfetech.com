          <p>Amazon has been lying to you about its prices from day one.</p>
          <p>It’s true, they’ve been passing off their “low prices” as the lowest in the market, but they have been lying for years!</p>
          <p>But now you have the power in your own hands to get the lowest prices on the planet on all types of goods, from food to sneakers to electronics and more. Amazon has an amazing selection, but did you know there is a way to actually get prices even lower than what Amazon offers? All you need is an amazing little app called Capital One Shopping.</p>
          <a href="https://savingsscanner.org/click" target="_blank">
            <figure class="txt-center">
              <img src="./assets/image-1.png" alt="" width="100%">
            </figure>
          </a>
          <p>Oh…did we mention, it’s absolutely free?  That’s right, there is a free app you can download to your browser that will help you find the lowest prices on Amazon with hardly any effort.</p>
          <p>Well, what are you waiting for? How about a quick description of how it all works.</p>
          <p>First, you download the Capital One Shopping app to your browser. Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox… it works with them all.</p>
          <p>Next, you shop on Amazon as usual, visiting any product page and the app will check to make sure the price is showing the actual lowest price available. In less than a second, the app will look for deals, promo codes, coupons, Prime status and more. If the app finds a better deal a little tag will show how much you can save.</p>
          <p>It’s…that…easy!</p>
          <p>Once in a while, you’ll see that Amazon is really showing the lowest price, but with this free app you’ll save hundreds of dollars a month depending on how much you shop.</p>
          <p>Try it now by clicking the button below. Let us know how much you save!</p>
