          <p>2020 has been so intense I totally forgot Black Friday is right around the corner (crazy right?).</p>
          <p>But now, between how tight money is and how little time I have to shop I’m worried about spending too much money.</p>
          <p>Thankfully, I found this amazing new extension called Capital One Shopping that not only made shopping super easy, but it helped me save a ton of money.</p>
          <p>It’s nuts right? Saving money when shopping online, even at discount websites seems crazy but it totally worked for me and now I’ve actually got $100 left over to buy myself a few things!</p>

          </a>
          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>Frist, get your list of gifts together. Normally, I create a list of who I’m buying for, what they want and what I can actually afford. Then before you pull out your credit card, do something a little different.</p>
          <p>Second, download this amazing free extension called Capital One Shopping. It’ll help you find deals you may not know about. I found this awesome Best Buy deal that had a promo code I didn’t even know existed! I wound up saving another $14 on just one gift!</p>
          <p>Third, shop until your fingers fall off.</p>
          <p>Honestly, it’s the best way to save money on all your shopping this holiday season. Maybe your budget is 50% of what it normally is because of the economy… no worries! You can still buy amazing gifts for your friends and family with this amazing extension.</p>
          <p>Plus, Capital One Shopping is totally free to download! This isn’t some department store credit card, it’s a free browser extension that is designed to help you save money.</p>
          <p>Act now and get your shopping done early this year for way less money. You’ll be glad you did!</p>
