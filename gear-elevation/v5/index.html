        Concerned Wife Finds Weird Way To Boost Flu-Prone Husbandâ€™s Weak Immune
        System
      </h1>

      <p class="text md">
        Tom Martin isn't the typical person when it comes to getting sick. While
        most people get to take their strong immune systems for granted, his
        wife noticed that he seemed to become sick from colds, sinus infections,
        and even the flu a lot more often than the typical person. In fact, Lisa
        stated, "It's not unusual for me to nurse my poor husband back to good
        health once every few months. It's been like that ever since we've been
        married. Which is more than a decade now."
      </p>
      <p class="text md">
        As fate would have it, Lisa became increasingly concerned about Tom's
        health as the rise of life-threatening flu strains began to sweep across
        the globe. She was certain that he was highly susceptible to these
        illnesses due to his inability to ward off common colds.
      </p>
      <p class="text md">
        She decided this was something that she and her husband desperately
        needed to change. So, she researched Google to find ways to strengthen
        Tom's immune system. At first, she came across a few well-known vitamins
        to add to his diet. The first was vitamin C. Vitamin C is a powerful
        antioxidant that can boost the body's natural defenses.
      </p>
      <p class="text md">
        "We kept plenty of oranges around the house and Tom enjoys eating them.
        So, I felt like we had the whole vitamin C thing pretty well covered,"
        Lisa said.
      </p>

            "My husband and I love this detox. I'll be honest, I was skeptical
            at first, but now I'm glad I made the investment. The water looks
            gross, but I genuinely FEEL BETTER afterwards, and that's what
            matters to me."

        Thoughtful Wife Helps Flu-Prone Husband Boost Immune System Using Weird
        Science
      </h2>
      <p class="text md">
        Her research continued and she came across zinc gluconate, another
        powerful immune system booster. "I also bought a zinc supplement every
        month to make sure Tom wasn't deficient of this vital nutrient." Zinc is
        an essential mineral that plays a vital role for more than 300 formed.
        It also helps maintain the immune system. However, the body doesn't
        store zinc so it needs to be consumed on a daily basis. "Tom is not a
        fan of eating red meat. So, I was certain that he had a zinc deficiency.
        It only made sense to buy a zinc supplement," Lisa said.
      </p>
      <p class="text md">
        Neither of these remedies were off of the beaten path. Healthcare
        providers have been advocating their benefits for decades. But after Tom
        came down with another cold while on a steady regimen of vitamin C and
        zinc gluconate, Lisa knew that her search had to continue.
      </p>
      <p class="text md">
        "I will say that the vitamins helped a little. Because he seemed to get
        over the cold a lot faster than usual. But my goal was to make sure that
        he didn't get sick so frequently," Lisa said.
      </p>
      <p class="text md">
        So, she continued her search for more ways to strengthen Tom's immune
        system and that's when she came across something unusual. It was a blog
        written by a naturopathic doctor recommending an ionic foot detox.
      </p>

      <figure class="framed-img">
        <img src="./img/img-3.jpg" alt="" />
      </figure>

      <p class="text md">
        "Initially, I was skeptical about the idea of a foot detox as a way to
        boost Tom's immune system. But when his body failed to respond favorably
        to the more traditional methods, I figured that there just might be
        something to this weird science."
      </p>
      <p class="text md">
        Experts estimate that the average American is exposed to about 70,000
        chemicals, with 65,000 of them being classified as toxic and potentially
        harmful. These toxins are impossible to avoid because more than 3,000 of
        these chemicals are found in our food supply with another 700 found in
        our drinking water. Frequent colds and illness could be a sign that the
        immune system is overworked. Because the body is placing too much
        emphasis on the elimination of these toxins. However, a foot detox gives
        the body some extra help when it comes to getting rid of these harmful
        chemicals.
      </p>

      <figure class="framed-img">
        <img src="./img/img-4.jpg" alt="" />
      </figure>

      <p class="text md">
        "According to naturopaths, once the body places less emphasis on
        eliminating toxins, it can start focusing more on serious health
        conditions. That fundamental belief seemed to have some real merit to
        it," Lisa stated. So, she decided to have Tom give the whole foot detox
        therapy a try.
      </p>
      <p class="text md">
        Lisa states, "I realize that this could just be anecdotal. But once Tom
        started taking those foot baths every other day, it seems like he
        stopped getting sick so frequently. He hasn't been sick for 6 months.
        I'm urging everyone with a weak immune system to give this therapy a
        try."
      </p>
      <p class="text md">
        This is exciting news during these troubling times, and it could mean a
        world of difference for the right person.
