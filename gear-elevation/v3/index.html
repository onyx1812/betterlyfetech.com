              Your Loved Ones Deserve This Experience
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              What if everyone in your home, especially your spouse, could enjoy
              an amazing foot spa treatment at home whenever they’d like?
              Wouldn’t it be fantastic if the person who you love could just put
              their tired feet in a warm foot bath that relaxed them and
              released all sorts of toxins?
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Well, the Ion Pure™ Ionic Detox Foot Bath is the #1 at-home spa
              treatment for the person you love most. Imagine giving him or her
              the chance a way to truly de-stress with an at-home foot spa that
              releases all sorts of toxins!
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">Spa Treatments Cost Big bucks</h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Look, any type of spa treatment is expensive and with all kinds of
              lockdowns in place, who knows if your favorite place will even be
              open tomorrow! Any truly effective foot spa treatment has to be
              done regularly to get the best results. Toxins build up over the
              years and decades and one treatment will not solve the problem.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Now, think about how expensive it would be to get the best spa
              treatment you can for your feet three times a week for six
              month...pretty expensive right?
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">The Old Options Just Don’t Work Right</h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Up until now, people had to resort to Epsom salts and foot masks
              to detoxify their feet. And that’s if people even knew enough to
              detox their feet at all!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              The problem is, a serious foot detox takes time, the right
              ingredients and regular use for it to have its full impact.
            </p>

            <p class="text md">
              Luckily, Ion Pure created a solution that’s being used by 1000’s
              of new people every day because of how effective it is.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">There Is A Secret To This Spa Treatment</h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Foot baths have been around for thousands of years. But, Ion
              Pure’s Professional-Grade Ionic Detox Foot Bath includes something
              truly unique – ionization. The Ionic Detox Foot Bath comes with an
              ionizer which, when placed in the water, releases ions through the
              water and into your body through your feet. The chemical process
              of hydrolysis uses the salts and excretes fats from the feet that
              will change the color of the water that your feet are soaking in
              from clear to a brownish color.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Your cells are then energized by the ions and are empowered to
              release all the toxins, the oils, fats, heavy metals, acids and
              other “cellular debris” which has accumulated over your lifetime.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Maybe you've gotten a foot bath at a salon or clinic. Well, you're
              not getting the full effect. We recommend you use it every other
              day up to 3 times per week for the first two months for 30 minutes
              a session. Your feet are full of more toxins than you can imagine,
              and you need to put in the work to help clear them out. You'll
              notice that the colors of the foot bath aren't as pronounced over
              time, which is an indication that the detoxification is running
              its course.
