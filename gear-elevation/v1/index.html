            <h2 class="title md">World’s Best Detox</h2>
            <p class="text md">
              What if you could erase every single one of the toxins you have in
              your body? Wouldn’t it be awesome to perform a full detox and get
              rid of all harmful substances in your body left behind by alcohol,
              fast food and chemicals?
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Well, thanks to the people at Ion Pure™, you can use their
              Professional-Grade Ionic Detox Foot Bath and cleanse yourself at
              last! A detoxifying foot bath can remove toxins that are stored in
              the fat cells of the body.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">Your Feet Hold So Many Toxins!</h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Your feet are some of the most toxin-filled parts of your body
              because they get very little exposure to the air. Plus, everything
              you stand on can put chemicals and toxic substances into your
              body. Toxic chemicals, petro chemicals, chemical byproducts and
              biological toxins are absorbed into your fat cells daily.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Think about a substance you come into contact with every week -
              gasoline. Sure, you do your best not to let it touch you, but even
              the fumes are toxic. Gas contains roughly 150 different chemicals
              including benzene which is a known cancer-causing chemical. When
              even small quantities enter the bloodstream it can reduce your
              central nervous system function and cause organ damage. Now, think
              about how many times per week, per month, per year and per decade
              you put your feet in a gas station.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">The Old Solutions Aren’t Cutting It</h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Up until now, people had to resort to Epsom salts and foot masks
              to detoxify their feet. And that’s if people even knew enough to
              detox their feet at all!
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              The problem is, a serious foot detox takes time, the right
              ingredients and regular use for it to have its full impact.
            </p>

            <p class="text md">
              Luckily, Ion Pure created a solution that’s being used by 1000’s
              of new people every day because of how effective it is.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title md">The Secret Behind The World’s Best Detox</h2>
            <figure class="img-wrap">
              <img src="../img/v5-2.png" alt="" />
            </figure>
            <p class="text md">
              Foot baths have been around for thousands of years. But, Ion
              Pure’s Professional-Grade Ionic Detox Foot Bath includes something
              truly unique – ionization. The Ionic Detox Foot Bath comes with an
              ionizer which, when placed in the water, releases ions through the
              water and into your body through your feet. The chemical process
              of hydrolysis uses the salts and excretes fats from the feet that
              will change the color of the water that your feet are soaking in
              from clear to a brownish color.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Your cells are then energized by the ions and are empowered to
              release all the toxins, the oils, fats, heavy metals, acids and
              other “cellular debris” which has accumulated over your lifetime.
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              Maybe you've gotten a foot bath at a salon or clinic. Well, you're
              not getting the full effect. We recommend you use it every other
              day up to 3 times per week for the first two months for 30 minutes
              a session. Your feet are full of more toxins than you can imagine,
              and you need to put in the work to help clear them out. You'll
              notice that the colors of the foot bath aren't as pronounced over
              time, which is an indication that the detoxification is running
              its course.

              1000’s Of People Are Raving About It
            </h2>
            <p class="text md">
              Don’t just take our word for it, we did a real-life demonstration
              with one of our customers and she raved about the results:
            </p>
            <p class="text md">
              I purchased the Ionic Detox Foot Bath, and it really does work --
              it pulls out whatever toxins are built up in your body. Since I
              take a lot of pain med's my liver is toxic. You can tell what it
              is pulling out by the color the water turns. After the session you
              should drink lots of water to replace the fluids that are lost by
              removing the toxins and it is important only to do a foot bath. I
              will say that it has helped me tremendously in the area of
              removing toxins
