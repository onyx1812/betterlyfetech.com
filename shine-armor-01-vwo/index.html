              <br />~ Darrell N. <b>Verified Purchase</b>
            </p>
            <h3>&ldquo;I was humiliated. My neighbor paid me $200 to detail his car... then a week later I found out he re-did my work by himself... and did a better job!&rdquo;
            </h3>
            <div class="bd-solid">&nbsp;
            </div>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re a car lover who can&rsquo;t go a week without cleaning your car, then you need to hear about this revolutionary new detailing product car owners are saying is a &ldquo;must-have.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>But first...
            </p>
            <p>Meet <b>Darrell Steinecker</b> &mdash; the only man classic car owners trust.
            </p>
            <p>Darrell Steinecker is a professional car detailer.
            </p>
            <p>He&rsquo;s been detailing classic cars for over 15 years.
            </p>
            <p>His work has been seen at hundreds of car shows in the United States, with many of his followers calling him the &ldquo;Detail Doctor.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>He&rsquo;s polished and prepped every vehicle imaginable, from Corvettes to Lamborghinis to Ford trucks to rare classic cars.
            </p>
            <p>Everything and anything that can be polished, Darrell is your man.
            </p>
            <p>Darrell loves what he does so much, he would even detail his neighbors&rsquo; cars for a discount... and sometimes he would give his neighbor&rsquo;s car a quick shine as a surprise without telling the owner.
            </p>
            <p>That was until one day Darrell came home early from his detailing appointments and caught his neighbor cheating on him with a 1968 Barracuda...
            </p> <img alt="barracuda" src="./img/Barracuda-2-30-HC.jpg" />
            <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; Darrell said, &ldquo;He paid me $200 to detail his car last week... then a week later I see him re-doing my work out in the open like I wouldn&rsquo;t find out...&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p class="quote"><i>See why thousands of serious car detailers are throwing out their old car wax for this new car sealant that&rsquo;s been formulated by a professional car detailer!
              <br /><a href="https://betterlyfetech.com/shine-armor-01/">Click here now to learn more about this game-changing &ldquo;Shine Armor&rdquo; formula.</a> </i>
            </p>
            <h3>Here&#39;s Why Car Detailers Are Ditching Their Hand Wax
            </h3>
            <p>Darrell always thought of himself as a decent car detailer...
            </p>
            <p>But when he found his neighbor re-polishing his 1968 Barracuda&mdash; the same Barracuda Darrell polished a week prior&mdash; Darrell began to question his skills...
            </p>
            <p>&ldquo;I remember thinking maybe my work wasn&rsquo;t up to his standard. I felt a little betrayed,&rdquo; Darrell laughed. &ldquo;But maybe there was something I was missing. <b>I had to find out.&rdquo;</b>
            </p>
            <p>Darrell approached his neighbor who put up his hands and said...
            </p>
            <p class="tac fs"><b><i>&quot;You caught me!&quot;</i></b>
            </p>
            <p>Then after some explanation and apologizing and saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Darrel&rsquo;s neighbor finally gave up and walked into his garage...
            </p>
            <p>He then walked back out holding a sleek spray bottle called Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️ and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing. I just needed a little more.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <h3>What Is Fortify Quick Coat Shine Armor&trade;️ and Why Are Car Enthusiasts Loving It So Much?
            </h3> <img alt="bottles" src="./img/10.jpg" />
            <p class="quote">&ldquo;Others can leave a film... or they take forever to buff into the car, giving you a cramp. This is almost too easy and too fun... it&rsquo;s honestly addicting to use.&rdquo;
              <br /><a href="https://betterlyfetech.com/shine-armor-01/">Click here to learn more now &raquo;</a>
            </p>
            <p><b>Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️</b> is &ldquo;detailer&rsquo;s choice&rdquo; for when it comes to getting a &ldquo;Shine Armor&rdquo; that protects your vehicle from contaminants and weather elements for up to a whole 6 months!
            </p>
            <h3>The best part?
            </h3>
            <p>Unlike clumpy wax that requires more elbow-grease than anticipated, Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️ goes on smooth and even... and rubs in fast with very little pressure.
            </p>
            <h3>What does classic car detailer, Darrell Steinecker think of it?
            </h3>
            <p><b>&ldquo;Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️</b> is the first wax, sealant, and protector that feels like it&rsquo;s formulated by actual car detailers... folks that really know how car paint reacts to polish.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old school. I use Collinite 845 and micro-fiber cloths... and then I take a few Advil at night to help with the elbow pain...
            </p>
            <p>...but I&rsquo;m changing to <b>Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️</b> because it actually shines better and it&rsquo;s easier to rub in.
            </p>
            <p>Plus I can detail a few more cars and earn more money because the process is much much faster than before.&rdquo;

            </p>
            <p>As you can imagine, with a product this good, the news has quickly spread within the various car communities.
            </p>
            <p>Long story short, <b>Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️</b> has been flying off the shelves...
            </p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s why clever car owners that know a good deal when they see one are taking the opportunity to stock up on bottles of <b>Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️</b> knowing they are going to save the most money.
            </p>
            <p>With thousands of positive reviews online, it&rsquo;s only time before <b>Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️</b> sells out of their current inventory...
            </p>
            <p>Keep in mind, <b>Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️</b> is difficult and expensive to make. In other words, once they sell out, it will take at least 30 days before they&rsquo;re able to sell their inventory again.
            </p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a price we pay,&rdquo; says the owner of Forfity, &ldquo;but we only work in small batches because we&rsquo;re not that big of a company, and ensures each bottle is top-notch quality.&rdquo;

            </p>
            <p>The owner of <b>Fortify Shine Armor&trade;️</b> is aware there are other sealants out there. However, many of these formulas are lacking the right measurements of polishing ingredients.
            </p>
            <p>And you&rsquo;re a smart car owner, so you&rsquo;ve probably heard the horror stories of people getting their favorite car polished... only to find paint swirls and stains...
